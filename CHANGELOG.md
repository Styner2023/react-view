# react-view

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#102](https://github.com/uber/react-view/pull/102) [`89350f4`](https://github.com/uber/react-view/commit/89350f40c745aca38ef78e58efd8c4b6191b7788) Thanks [@tajo](https://github.com/tajo)! - No breaking changes really, just bumping all dependencies and modernizing the tooling. Live code that has export default gets wrapped by an additional IIEF, so you can have other variables defined at the root scope.
